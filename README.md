**Authentication Module with FIDO2 (WebAuthn) and Face Recognition**
This is a prototype **authentication module** that combines _FIDO2 (WebAuthn)_ with face recognition (_face-api.js_). It supports passwordless sign-up and sign-in using either a FIDO2-compatible device (e.g., Android phone) or facial descriptors based on multiple emotional states.

**üîê Sign-Up Flow**
During sign-up, the module captures three facial expressions (normal, smiling, gloomy) as face descriptors. The system verifies emotion detection before saving the descriptors.

**üîì Sign-In Flow**
**Note**: _QR-authentication is not implemented._
The user must present the same three facial expressions as during sign-up. The system compares the new descriptors with the stored ones.
